This project was undertaken for a Bank in pursuit of a BI Developer position, which ultimately secured me the role of BI Specialist. It marked my first exposure to QlikView, necessitating a quick grasp of its syntax. I utilized ETL processes and SQL Server to clean and calculate data's KPIs, while also referring to Investopedia.com for the necessary calculations. The objective of the QlikView dashboard was to analyze a company's stock behavior.
