# Data Enginering and BI E2E Project
## Overview

This project was initiated as part of my application process for a BI Developer position at a bank. It ultimately played a pivotal role in securing my current position as a BI Specialist. The project involved working with QlikView for the first time, necessitating a rapid acquisition of its syntax and functionalities. 

### Project Highlights

- Utilized ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes to clean and calculate key performance indicators (KPIs) from raw data.
- Employed SQL Server for data manipulation and transformation.
- Referred to Investopedia.com for necessary calculations and financial insights.
- Designed a QlikView dashboard with the primary objective of analyzing a company's stock behavior.
